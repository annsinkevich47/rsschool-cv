# About Myself:

I started my career by studying at BSU at the Faculty of Biology. After completing a five-year specialty as a biotechnologist, I successfully found a job at the institute.
At the moment, I am interested in studying WEB-development because it is a versatile, creative and promising profession that allows you to achieve results that match your efforts.
I completed the HTML and CSS courses, at the moment I have basic knowledge in JS and GIT and plan to further develop and train my skills, constantly learning something new to become a true developer.

# Skills

    HTML5, CSS3
    JavaScript Basics
    Git, GitHub
    VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA
    Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign

# Code Example
**Sum without highest and lowest number KATA from CODEWARS:**
    Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).
The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.
Mind the input validation.

    function sumArray(array) {
        if (array == null || array.length  <=2) {
                return 0;
        }
        else if (array.length > 2) {
            let x = Math.min.apply(null, array);
            let y = Math.max.apply(null, array);
            let d = array.reduce((a , b)=> a + b);
            let h = d - x - y
            return h;
        } 
    }
