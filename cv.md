About Myself:

I started my career by studying at BSU at the Faculty of Biology. After completing a five-year specialty as a biotechnologist, I successfully found a job at the institute.
At the moment, I am interested in studying WEB-development because it is a versatile, creative and promising profession that allows you to achieve results that match your efforts.
I completed the HTML and CSS courses, at the moment I have basic knowledge in JS and GIT and plan to further develop and train my skills, constantly learning something new to become a true developer.
